<hr/>

<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>Location it was shot in and the actors. the motive or story behund the whole film had a deeper meaning and could be tied to a sertain if not more than one religeon.</p>

<h3>Sing 2</h3>
<p>It takes you back to your yoouth days. You watch the movie and forget about all the "Adult" thing going on and enjoy the singing and dancing like a child again.</p>

<h3>Bridgerton</h3>
<p>Not a movie but definitly worth metioning. The first an second season had their moment but with the #dr you become hooked all over again and I can't seem to get enough. The wait for part 2 to be released seems like forever.</p>
